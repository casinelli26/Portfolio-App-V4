To start working on this project you need to install Python 3 and MongoDB 3.2 onto your OS.
Once you have Python installed make sure that you have all the installed requirements to run the application.

Once you have MongoDB installed on your OS make sure it is running in the background otherwise the application cannot
initialize the database.

The requirements are listed in the requirements.txt file. If you are using PyCharm, then PyCharm will install the
modules for you. Otherwise you will need to use PIP to install these extensions.

If you are using sublime text to work on this project, the main .py file you need to execute the program is run.py.
