1. Need to figure out how to throw an error message if the user enters an incorrect ticker, qty of shares, or if a user
leaves these fields blank.
    - Also need to do this for the portfolio field
    - We will create try / except to raise an error message which will load onto the html page.

    Error messages we need to make.
    1. Stock cannot be found.
    2. Stock is already in the database, you should update stock instead.
    3. Stock cannot be deleted because it cannot be found.
    4. Need to figure out how to have the same stock in different portfolios.

2. Need to sum the total value of all stocks in the portfolio.

3. Make the template look nicer!


5. Edit the application so we can add / delete / remove portfolios.
